# AP-LAB-Project
Boid Simulation using Python
This is a mini project made for onr of the lab courses in MIT, Manipal.
The basic gist of the project is simulating boids (bird-oid objects) using python. 
This is done by programming each separate boid to follow certain rules depending on their location relative to the surrounding boids. 
This way we can observe the group behaviour created as the result. We can change the factors based on the rules and observe resultant changes.
